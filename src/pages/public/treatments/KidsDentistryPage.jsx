            If you think your child is too young to need root canal treatment, think again — there is no age limit for this treatment. If his/her primary (baby) teeth have been injured, or if decay has advanced deep into the roots of your child's teeth, a root canal treatment to stabilize teeth may be needed. Root canal treatment removes the infection from the pulp, the living tissue that is found inside the tooth's roots. The pulp contains the tooth's nerves, so tooth pain is often an indication that decay has moved into the pulp. Root canal treatment is a simple procedure wherein instruments are used to clean the root canals of teeth followed by inserting a medication so as to maintain the teeth properly in the oral cavity.

            Frequently children acquire certain habits that may either temporarily or permanently be harmful to teeth and tooth supporting structures. These habits are acquired as a result of repetition. In the initial stages, there is a conscious effort to perform the act. Later the act becomes less conscious and if repeated often enough may enter the realms of unconsciousness. Some common oral habits seen in children include thumb sucking, mouth breathing, tongue thrusting, lip biting, grinding of teeth and nail-biting.

              A common problem for which parents usually take their children to the dentist is decay. This is because there is a lack of proper dexterity of brushing in children. To avoid the problem of decay, parents should get the Fluoride application treatment in children at regular intervals. Fluoride helps to fight plaque and bacteria which can cause enamel loss which further causes cavities. Fluoride also strengthens the tooth structure & helps in bone growth. Under this treatment, the dentist incorporates fluoride ions into the tooth structure making them more prone to acid dissolution. This treatment is equally useful for both milk & permanent teeth.

              The main reason for decay is the food and bacteria that is trapped in the pits & fissures of teeth. We chew food from the back teeth like molars and premolars which are never flat. The pits & fissures as discussed above are the depressions on these back teeth. They function as potential traps for bacteria & food and make it susceptible to decay. Therefore, as a preventive measure, certain pits and fissure sealants are placed. Dental sealants then come to the rescue. Sealants are plastic coatings placed on the chewing surface of the permanent tooth. They protect the tooth from decay. Because of fissures the permanent back teeth, molars, and premolars are vulnerable to decay. As we talked about the habits, it is important to inculcate the habit of maintaining good oral health at a very initial stage. This is an investment which will pay lifelong dividends in the form of healthy teeth and a healthy lifestyle. Parents should take initiatives to teach their children the correct technique of brushing and for that, it is highly important that they themselves should know the correct way of brushing. Make brushing a fun-filled activity for your child, brush along with them and encourage them to take preventive actions.

              Apart from the aforementioned treatment options, make sure that your kids brush twice daily. Brushing before sleeping is extremely important because the food you eat during the day get stuck between your teeth and bacteria in your mouth will feed on that food overnight causing decay. If possible teach your child how to floss as it is the added protection for your teeth
