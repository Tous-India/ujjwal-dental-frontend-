/**
 * Direct browser -> Cloudinary upload.
 *
 * WHY: the API runs as a Vercel serverless function, which enforces a HARD
 * ~4.5MB request body limit that cannot be raised from application code.
 * Report uploads used to stream the file THROUGH the API, so every byte
 * counted against that ceiling. Phone camera photos are routinely 3-12MB, so
 * they were rejected by the platform before our code ever ran -- while
 * sub-2MB desktop files sailed through. That is the entire "works on desktop,
 * fails on every phone" bug.
 *
 * The limit was also CUMULATIVE: the report endpoint accepts up to 10 files in
 * one request, so even a few mid-size files together could breach it.
 *
 * Now the browser uploads each file straight to Cloudinary with a short-lived
 * signature minted by our backend, and only the resulting metadata (a few
 * hundred bytes) is posted to us. Nothing large touches the function, so
 * neither the per-file nor the cumulative limit applies.
 *
 * Uploads are SIGNED, never unsigned -- an unsigned preset would let anyone on
 * the internet write into the Cloudinary account. The signature is obtained
 * from an authenticated endpoint and pins the folder server-side.
